  <h1>Will Cutting Out Dairy Give Me Clear Skin?</h1>
  <a class="share-link" href="#">Share full article</a>


  <p>Nutrition research is inherently difficult to conduct, and few studies have examined the relationship between dairy and acne in general, so results are often conflicting, said Dr. Andrea Zaenglein, a pediatric dermatologist at the Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Experts can only hypothesize as to what the underlying connections may be, and so far the results of studies have been limited and mixed.</p>
  <p>In one study of 225 teenagers published in 2016, for example, Dr. Zaenglein and her co-authors found that those who drank low-fat or skim milk were more likely to have acne than those who drank whole milk. In another study published in 2016 and performed on more than 1,000 adults, researchers concluded that whole milk (in addition to reduced-fat milk) was linked to the appearance of pimples.</p>
  <p>When it comes to yogurt and cheese, there is no evidence that they can lead to more breakouts, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association.

Some dermatologists suggest that the amount of milk (rather than the type of milk) you consume may be most important in acne flare-ups. Others have hypothesized that the artificial and natural hormones present in milk could influence breakouts. And limited research has suggested that the whey protein found in milk might be linked to pimples in some people, based on case studies of athletes whose acne improved after cutting out whey supplements.</p>
